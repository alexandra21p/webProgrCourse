                I'm worried I'll forget your face |

                On the phone to the middle man |
                When I saw that she was on her own |
                I thought she might understand |
                She was close, well you couldn't get much closer | <br>
                She said "I'm really not supposed to but yes |
                You can call me anything you want" <br>

                One, two tries won't do it |
                You do it all your life and you never get through it |

                We won't take that shit." | <br>

                Is this what you want, is this who you are? |

                'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine |
                Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you |
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line" |
