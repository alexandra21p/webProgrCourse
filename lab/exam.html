    The syntax in HTML5 is extremely clear and simple as compared to HTML4. One example of this is the DOCTYPE element.
    In HTML4 the DOCTYPE declaration was too messy and lengthy and used to refer an external source. However in HTML5 DOCTYPE
    element has been made extremely simple, e.g. "< !DOCTYPE html>" is enough to specify the document type. <br>
    HTML5 contains built in support for integrated multimedia files into web page via video and audio tags.
    Previously, in HTML4, the multimedia content was integrated in web pages via third party plugins such as Silverlight and flash. <br>
    In HTML4, JavaScript and the browser interface with which user interacts, run in the same thread which affects performance.
    HTML5 contains JS Web Worker API which allows JavaScript and Browser interface to run in separate threads. <br>
    HTML4 is an established standard for developing browser applications and has been in use for more than 10 years and because of this,
    it's compatible with almost all web-browsers. On the other hand, HTML5 is still in the process of evolution and the
    currently available tags are being modified and also new tags are being added.
    Therefore, HTML5 lags behind HTML4 in terms of compatibility with the browsers.
    Several tags in HTML4 have been removed from HTML5 or their functionality has been modified: <br>
     - removed: < applet> (instead added < object>), < acronym> (instead added < abbr>) <br>
     - newly added: < canvas>, new media elements: < embed>, < source>, < track> <br>
    Attribute differences: <br> - In HTML4 and previous HTML versions, script attribute was used to in link tag to refer to JavaScript or other similar scripts.
    In HTML5 It is not necessary to use that script attribute. <br>
     - In HTML5, the < table> tag can only have the border attribute and the value of this attribute can only be zero or one.
    Previously, the < table> tag had many attributes.
